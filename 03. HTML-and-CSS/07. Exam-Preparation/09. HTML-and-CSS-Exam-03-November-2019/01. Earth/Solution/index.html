                        Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object
                        known to harbor life. According to radiometric dating and other sources of
                        evidence, Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago.

                        Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane,
                        producing seasons on Earth. The gravitational interaction between Earth and
                        the Moon causes tides, stabilizes Earth's orientation on its axis, and
                        gradually slows its rotation.
